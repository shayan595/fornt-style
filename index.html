    <h1>eren yeager</h1>
    <p class="99"> is an American multinational technology company focusing on artificial intelligence,[9] online advertising,
        search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and consumer
        electronics. It has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world"[10] and as one of the world's
        most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field of
        artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta, and Microsoft, Google's parent company
        Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech companies.

        Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they
        were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed
        shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via
        an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of
        Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet
        properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page,
        who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]

        The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of
        which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail),
        navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity
        (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage
        (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch &
        Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google
        Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include
        gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]

        Google's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing
        (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk
        Labs), and transformer models (Google Deepmind).[17]

        Google and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and X. Google is also the
        largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform,
        photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant
        provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second
        by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as
        privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.

    <p>As of December 2016, Alphabet has acquired over 200 companies, with its largest acquisition being the purchase of
        Motorola Mobility, a mobile device manufacturing company, for $12.5 billion. Most of the firms acquired by
        Google are based in the United States, and, in turn, most of these are based in or around the San Francisco Bay
        Area. To date, Alphabet has divested itself of four[2] business units: Frommers, which was sold back to Arthur
        Frommer in April 2012;[3] SketchUp, which was sold to Trimble in April 2012,[4] Boston Dynamics in early 2016
        and Google Radio Automation, which was sold to WideOrbit in 2009.[5]

        Many Google products originated as services provided by companies that Google has since acquired. For example,
        Google's first acquisition was the Usenet company Deja News, and its services became Google Groups. Similarly,
        Google acquired Dodgeball, a social networking service company, and eventually replaced it with Google Latitude.
        Other acquisitions include web application company JotSpot, which became Google Sites; Voice over IP company
        GrandCentral, which became Google Voice; and video hosting service company Next New Networks, which became
        YouTube Next Lab and Audience Development Group. CEO Larry Page has explained that potential acquisition
        candidates must pass a sort of "toothbrush test": Are their products potentially useful once or twice a day, and
        do they improve your life?[6]

        Following the acquisition of Israel-based startup Waze in June 2013, Google submitted a 10-Q filing with the
        Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) that revealed that the corporation spent $1.3 billion on acquisitions
        during the first half of 2013, with $966 million of that total going to Waze.[7]</p>
